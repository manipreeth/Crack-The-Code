## Rules of the Game

🔐 Start the game by clicking the "Generate Number" button, which generates a number that should be cracked.

🔢 Enter your number (0-9) to crack the code in the input area provided and click the "Check" button.

🎨 To know whether the digits of your input match with the digits of the number generated, you can make use of the background colors associated with the numbers:

- Background color of digits becomes:
  - 🟢 Green - if the digit and position of digit match with the number generated.
  - 🟠 Orange - if the digit is included but the position of digit does not match with the number generated.
  - 🔴 Red - if the digit is not present in the number generated.

⏱️ You have **five** chances of successfully cracking the code.

- 2nd attempt - 9 points
- 3rd attempt - 8 points
- 4th attempt - 7 points
- 5th attempt - 6 points (Final attempt)

❌ If a user is unable to crack the code after five successful attempts, then the user is awarded **zero** points.
